1. What is index; types of indices; pros and cons

Clustered Index, Non-clustered index.

Pro: 


2. What's the difference between Primary key and Unique constraint?

1) There can only be one primary key while many unique keys. 
2) Also, primary cannot be NULL while unique constraint can be NULL.
3) Primary key sorts the table automatically. Unique does not.

3. Tell me about check constraint

In DML, the constraint is to use to specify the datatype, key of data and filter the data according to 
some user-defined condition.

4. Difference between temp table and table variable

--1. both are stored in tempdb
--2.scope: local/global, current batch
--3. size: > 100 rows, < 100 rows 
--4. do not use temp tables in stored procedures or user defined functions, but we can use table variables in sp, function

5. Difference between WHERE and HAVING

Having follows aggregation statements.

WHERE does not have to follow .

6. Difference between RANK() and DenseRank() â€” value gap

RANK() has value gap if there is a tie. DenseRANK() does not have value gap.

7. COUNT(*) vs. COUNT(colName)

COUNT(*) returns the num of all columns including NULL columns.
COUNT(colName) returns the num of non-NULL columns.

8. What's the difference between left join and inner join? JOIN and Subquery, which one has a
better performance, why?

left join keeps all the rows of left table. 
inner join keeps the intersection of rows of both tables.

Join performs better as SQL language is embedded with join optimizer.

9. What is correlated subquery

Inner query is dependent on outter query.

10. What is a CTE, why do we need CTE?

cte: comment table expression.
Recursive

11. What does SQL Profiler do?

SQL Profiler is a user interface which is used to monitor database for the data engine and further analysis.

12. What is SQL injection, how to avoid SQL injection?

SQL injection is the action of hackers injecting macilous code to destroy our data.

13. Difference between SP and user defined function? When to use SP when to use function?

SP refers to the stored procedure, a prepared sql query that we can save in our db and reuse whenever we need.

14. Criteria of Union and Union all? Difference between UNION and UNION ALL

--Criteria 
--Columns of both tables have the same number and name.

-- Differences
-- Union will delete the duplicates


15. Steps you take to improve SQL Queries

--1. Avoid unnecessary joins.
--2. Make good use of index 
--3. Avoid selecting *
--4. derived table to avoid too much grouping of non-aggregated field.
--5. use join to replace subquery

16. concurrency problem in transaction

Two or more quires work on the same datebase at the same time.

--1. Dirty Read: t1 allows t2 to read uncommitted data and t1 rolls back.


--dirty reads:if t1 allows t2 to read uncommitted data, and then t1 rolled back
    --caused by isolation level read uncommitted
    --solved by isolation level read committed
--lost update: when t1 and t2 read and update the same data but t2 finish its work earlier than t1, then t2 will lose their update
    --caused by isolation level read committed
    --solved by isolation level repeatble read
--non-repeatable read: t1 read the same data twice while t2 is updating the data
    --caused by isolation level read committed
    --solved by isolation level repeatble read
--phantom read: t1 reads the same data twice while t2 is inserting records
    --caused by isolation level repeatable read
    --solved by isolation level serializable


17. what is deadlock, how to prevent

18. what is normalization, 1NF - BCNF, benefits using normalization

19. what are the system defined databases?

20. composite key

21. candidate key

22. DDL vs. DML

Data Definining

23. ACID property

24. table scan vs. index scan

25. Difference between Union and JOIN
